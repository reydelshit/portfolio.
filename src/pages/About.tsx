          Highly motivated and skilled Full Stack Developer with over <strong>two years</strong> of
          experience in developing and deploying web applications. I am an inquisitive person who
          asks, asks, asks which might be annoying, but yeah, sorry. Iâ€™m also a guy who enjoys his
          beer and cigars without those, productivity lessens.

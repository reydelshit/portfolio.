          Highly motivated and skilled Full Stack Developer with over <strong>two years</strong> of experience in
          developing and deploying web applications. I am an inquisitive person who asks, asks, asks which might be
          annoying, but yeah, sorry. Iâ€™m also a guy who enjoys his beer and cigars without those, my productivity
          lessens.
